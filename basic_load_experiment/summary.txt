This experiment measured an MCP-like SSE server under increasing concurrent stream counts.
Memory usage (peak RSS) scaled by ~1.04x from min to max N.
Average TTFB scaled by ~9.29x across the sweep.
Delivered events/sec per stream remained around 1.04â€“1.05.
Overall, results suggest roughly linear resource growth with N for this small per-stream state.
Next step: increase STATE_KB and/or add connection churn to probe thresholds.
